# Manual Laravel Setup Guide

## Current Status ✅
- Your Laravel application is already configured to use CDN resources instead of Vite
- No @vite directives found in the layout file
- The application should work without building frontend assets

## What Was Done
1. ✅ Checked layout file - already using CDN resources (Bootstrap, jQuery, Tailwind CSS)
2. ✅ No @vite directives found - no replacement needed
3. ⚠️ npm/php binaries not properly installed due to permission issues

## Manual Steps to Complete Setup

### Option 1: Fix Package Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Fix dpkg issues first
sudo dpkg --configure -a

# Install PHP and Node.js properly
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y php8.4-cli php8.4-mbstring php8.4-xml php8.4-curl
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer

# Install Laravel dependencies
composer install

# Build frontend assets (optional since using CDN)
npm install
npm run dev

# Clear caches
php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear

# Start server
php artisan serve
```

### Option 2: Use Docker (Alternative)
```bash
# If you have Docker available
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 3: Manual File Setup
Since your app uses CDN resources, you can manually create the required files:

1. **Create mix-manifest.json** (if needed):
```json
{
    "/css/app.css": "/css/app.css",
    "/js/app.js": "/js/app.js"
}
```

2. **Ensure public/css/app.css exists** (copy from resources/sass/app.scss if needed)

3. **Ensure public/js/app.js exists** (copy from resources/js/app.js if needed)

## Current Application Status
- ✅ Layout file properly configured with CDN resources
- ✅ No Vite dependencies
- ✅ Ready to run (once PHP is properly installed)
- ✅ All views and controllers are in place

## Next Steps
1. Fix the package installation issues
2. Install PHP and Composer
3. Run `composer install` to install Laravel dependencies
4. Start the server with `php artisan serve`

The application should work immediately once PHP is properly installed since it's using CDN resources instead of built assets.
